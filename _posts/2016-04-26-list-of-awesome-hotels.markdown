Pau St Hotel Listing

Great Hotels - the Pau street list
This is a list of hotels that we recommend (or don’t recommend) around the world
Also - my tip as a YHA person - book direct if you can - you will nearly always save money and often the consolidators don’t put their best rooms or specials on booking.com
City/Country - anything anyone would search for to try and find
Hotel Name & Address/location
Type of recommendation
(Yes! Go there! No = stay away)
And by whom
What I loved (or hated)
What it cost(ish)
Brisbane, Queensland, Australia
Next (chain)
Yes! Go there! Brisbane. Good food, craft beer, close to shops and they don't shout NEXT!
